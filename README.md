# ATTO Self Driving Drone

<h1>Abstract</h1>
For the final project, our group decided to design a semi-autonomous vehicle system we call
ATTO. ATTO is a remote controlled car that can detect and avoid obstacles. We designed this
device to be the starter to larger projects like spacial mapping cars. ATTO was built up using
smaller blocks of hardware and software, our major blocks were: range sensor, motors, motor
controller, bluetooth, power distribution, user control application, and autonomous drive system.
These blocks were combined to build and test ATTO.

<h1>Introduction</h1>
The scope of the ATTO project is to create the chassis, and basic hardware and software
components of a self driving remote controlled car. The self driving features of ATTO can detect
and avoid obstacles in its path and report status information to the end user via onboard
bluetooth. The ATTO has independent bi-directional control over all its wheels, allowing it to
move forward and backward, turn left and right, and vary the speed of its wheels. Using infrared
sensors ATTO is able to detect obstacles directly in front, and on either flank. These sensors
are connected to ATTOâ€™s main drive controller which is able to appropriately react to obstacles
in its path.

The purpose of ATTO is to develop the introductory hardware for an autonomous spatial
mapping drone, or similar device. The end goal of ATTO is to be put in a room with
communication to a base computer and have it drive over the entire area of that room. This
behavior can be used in applications like roombas, spatial mapping, and spatial problem solving
robots.
